# House Price Prediction in New York City

This project uses machine learning models to analyze and predict house prices in New York City. The dataset includes various property features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location. We use regression, classification, and clustering models to understand price patterns and make predictions.

## Project Overview

1. **Regression Models**: Used to predict the price of houses based on features.
2. **Classification Models**: Categorized house prices into high and low categories based on the median price.
3. **Clustering Model (Optional)**: Applied clustering to group houses based on similarities in features like location and square footage.

### Dataset

- `PRICE`: House price
- `BEDS`: Number of bedrooms
- `BATH`: Number of bathrooms
- `PROPERTYSQFT`: Property square footage
